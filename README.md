# Stroop Test

In this project, I have made investigation on a classic phenomenon from experimental psychology called the Stroop Effect. I have learned a little bit about the experiment, create a hypothesis regarding the outcome of the task, then go through the task yourself. I then looke at some data collected from others who have performed the same task and computed some statistics describing the results. Finally, the results are interpreted in terms of my hypotheses.
